## Hole Driven Development

Source file steps which accompany a Haskell tutorial on Hole Driven 
Development (HDD).

There are the [individual steps](tree/master/src/step) and the 
[final result](tree/master/src/code/Hdd.hs).  Commits were made 
for each of the steps and can be seen in the history.

Have fun!
