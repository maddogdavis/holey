## Hole Driven Development

This is set of source file steps which accompany a tutorial on
Hole Driven Development in Haskell.

There are the [individual steps](tree/master/src/step) and the 
[final result](tree/master/src/code/Hdd.hs).  Commits were made 
for each of the steps and can be seen in the history.

Have fun!
