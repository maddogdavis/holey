## Hole Driven Development

Source file steps which accompany a Haskell tutorial on Hole Driven 
Development (HDD) using 
[Kleisli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleisli_category) composition.

Comprises [individual steps](src/step/) and the 
[final result](src/core/Hdd.hs).  Steps can be
in the commit history.

Have fun!
